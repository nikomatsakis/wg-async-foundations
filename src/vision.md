# ðŸ”® The vision

## What is this

Async-await first [stabilized] in November 2019, and today people are building all kinds of applications using it. We believe Rust can become one of the most popular choices for building distributed systems, ranging from embedded devices to foundational cloud services.

Regardless of their application, we want all developers to love using Async Rust. For that to happen, we need to move Async Rust beyond the "MVP" state it's in today and make it accessible to everyone.

This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Async Rust. **Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:** how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a *joyful* one?

## Involving the whole community

Building a truly great experience for Async Rust takes more than just `async fn`. We need to think about the end-to-end experience -- everything from what happens when people first learn Async Rust, to what happens as they are building their application, to what happens after deployment.

The challenge for us is to drive that holistic product experience while retaining the loosely coupled, exploration-oriented ecosystem we have built. Async Rust was intentionally designed not to have a "one size fits all" mindset, and we don't want to change that. But we need a forum where we can coordinate on the overall experience we are all shooting for. That is what this document is for!

## The vision drives the work

The vision is not just idle speculation. It is the central document that we use to organize ourselves. When we think about our [roadmap](./vision/roadmap.md) for any given year, it is always with the aim of moving us closer to the vision we lay out here.
