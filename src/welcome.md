## Getting involved

There is a weekly [triage meeting] that takes place in our [Zulip stream][zulip]. Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself. 

If you're interested in fixing bugs, though, there is no need to wait for the meeting! [Take a look at the instructions here.][fix-bugs]

[triage meeting]: ./triage.md
[fix-bugs]: ./triage.md#so-you-want-to-fix-a-bug

## What is the goal of this working group?

This working group is focused around implementation/design of the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other "core" bits of support offered by the Rust organization. We do not directly work on external projects like [tokio], [async-std], [smol], [embassy] and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.

[tokio]: https://tokio.rs/
[async-std]: https://async.rs/
[smol]: https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/
[embassy]: https://github.com/akiles/embassy

## Zulip
