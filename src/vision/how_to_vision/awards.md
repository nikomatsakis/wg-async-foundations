# ‚ùì How to vision: Awards

At the end of the [brainstorming period][htvbp], we'll also vote on various awards to give to the status quo and shiny future PRs that were submitted. 

## Award categories

We're still figuring out the best award categories and are looking for suggestions! If you have thoughts, drop by zulip to float it!

One rule: the awards can't be negative (e.g., no "most unrealistic"), and they can't be about which thing is "best". That would work against the brainstorming spirit.

Here are some ideas we've come up with so far:

* Most humorous story
* Most supportive -- who left the most helpful comments?
* Most prolific -- who wrote the most stories?
* Most unexpected -- which status quo story (or shiny future) took you by surprise?
* Most ambitious "shiny future" story
* Most painful "status quo" story
* Most extensive FAQ

Prizes are TBD.
