| ‚úÖ **Now!** | Propose [awards] for the narratives |
| üõë Starting 2021-04-02 | Propose new [shiny future narratives][hvsf] or [comment] on existing PRs |
| üõë Starting 2021-04-30 | [Vote] for the [awards] on the status quo and shiny future narratives! |

## The big picture

The plan is for work to proceed in two phases, **brainstorming** and **harmonizing**.

### Brainstorming

The brainstorming period runs until 2021-04-30:

* Folks [open status quo][hvsq] and (eventually) [shiny future][hvsf] narrative PRs.
* We collectively [comment] on these PRs, helping to improve them and make them more complete.
* **This is brainstorming**, so the attitude is "the more the merrier". 
    * If a status quo is totally different from your experience, or you have an alternate idea for what the shiny future might look like, just open up your own PR!
* At the end of the brainstorming period, we will vote and give [awards] for things like "most amusing". (We'd like suggestions on the best categories!)
* All PRs opened in this section will be merged into a "brainstorming" folder; they become the basis for the final document.

### Harmonizing

At this point, the [wg leads] will write the draft vision document, drawing on the status quo and shiny future stories that were submitted.
Like an RFC, this draft vision doc will be opened for comment and improved based on the resulting feedback.
When the [wg leads] feel it is ready, it will be taken to the [lang] and [libs] teams for approval (and other Rust teams as appropriate).

[libs]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library

### Living document

This meant to be a **living document**. We plan to revisit it regularly to track our progress and update it based on what we've learned in the meantime. Note that the shiny future stories in particular are going to involve a fair bit of uncertainty, so we expect them to change as we go.

## Wait, did somebody say awards?

Yes! We are planning to give [awards] in various categories for folks who write [status quo](./how_to_vision/status_quo.md) and [shiny future](./how_to_vision/shiny_future.md) PRs. The precise categories are TBD. Check out the [awards] page for more details.
