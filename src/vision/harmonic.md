# üéº The Harmonic Synthesis

## Key goals and points

By the time we reach our shiny future...

* **Working in async Rust should feel "analogous" to sync Rust to the extent possible:**
    * You should be able to write `async fn` anywhere you can write `fn` and things should generally work.
    * You should be able to rely on destructors to cleanup 
    * There should be a combination of quality learning resources, compiler diagnostics, helpful lints, and runtime feedback that ensures that, when you do have a problem, you can quickly understand what went wrong and how to fix it (this should be true both when getting started and at intermediate levels).
* **The complexity that underpins (pun intended) async Rust should be largely hidden from view:**
    * You should be able to do everything you want to do by writing `async fn`; implementing combinators and poll functions manually should not be necessary.
* **We should enable seamless interoperability both within the Rust ecosystem and across languages:**
    * It should be easy to write libraries that work across different runtimes.
    * Your async programs should be portable across different runtimes by default, enabling easy experimentation.
    * You should be able to interoperate with native runtimes available on your platform and the async mechanisms from other languages.
* **You should not be *surprised* by the semantics of your program; we want async Rust to have that same "if it compiles, it works as expected" feeling that sync Rust gives you:**
    * It should be easy to create parallel/concurrent tasks and create complex scheduling structures ("at most 5 of these requests at a time, combined with 1 of those") that work reliably and run efficiently. These tasks should be able to access borrowed data using a scope-like mechanism.
    * Cancellation should be both reliable (cancelling everything it makes sense to cancel) and unsurprising (not interrupting work in the middle).
    * Combining libraries and utilities from crates.io should not result in surprising panics nor in surprising event loops running in the background.    
* **We should help you to maintain and optimize your system over its lifecycle:**
    * It should be easy to figure out where your program is spending its time and to identify common async performance footguns and hazards.
    * It should be easy to writing testing harnesses to test your logic, simulate extreme networking events, and so forth.
* **The system should scale to all the niches and key use cases:**
    * Enabling zero-copy and the efficient use of io-uring
    * Enabling code that doesn't require thread-safety (e.g., worker per core) to avoid overhead from atomics
    * Writing efficient servers and networking hardware
    * Writing simpler servers and web frameworks
    * Writing networking clients 
    * Writing GUIs and games
    * Working on embedded platforms that do not have an operating system or standard library
    * Working on web assembly (exactly what this means is a bit of an open question)

## Some specific technical challenges

Achieving the previous points will not be easy! We think we have an outline of how to do it, but there are some key technical challenges to overcome.
Most or all of these have seen a lot of prior discussion:

* Traits that support async fn and offer various ways to make that dyn safe
* Async closures
* Generators to make writing iterators and async iterators easy
* Standard traits for portability tht are built on `async fn` primities (not the poll-based traits offered today):
    * async read
    * async write
    * async iteration
    * timers
    * opening TCP, UDP ports, potentially other standard I/O primities
    * spawning, spawn-blocking
* Easy, standard patterns for doing common I/O operations without specifying a runtime
    * presumably interacting with the traits above, but hopefully not requiring all portable code to be deeply generic
* Standard combinators for async iterators, futures, implemented largely using async fn
* Structured conncurrency: a way to launch tasks and to propagate cancellation downwards
    * This should provide alternatives to `FuturesUnordered` and stream that are not as error-prone
* A mechianism for being generic over sync vs async code
* Defining some form of drop impl that will run asynchronously
    * There remains debate about whether this is desirable. We argue that it is, because otherwise async code will always feel distinct from `Drop` code.

## Skill tree

What follows is a "skill tree" that describes the key points of the harmonic synthesis. Each of the "blocks" in the tree represents a kind of coherent experience that we can achieve. There are a few sentences describing the impact of this experience on users, and then a list of technical items that must be implemented to achieve that goal. Note that we can work on many of the technical items in parallel -- including items that appear relatively late in the tree.

Eventually we aim to have each of the nodes in this tree have an associated "shiny future" story spelling it out in more detail.
